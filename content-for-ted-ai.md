- Decentralized governance for git communities

## What?

Lifetime governance and management protocol for decentralized collaboration over git

### Lifelong plural economy

A holistic economic mechanism — based on a plural currency and designed for established collaboration workflows — ensures a fair allocation of influence to community members over the life of the project.

### Polls

Continuous polling for prioritizing community attention on project issues and pull requests, based on Quadratic Voting.

### Referendums

Plural referendums for approving important changes and pull requests.

### Prediction markets

Reward mechanisms — embodying prediction markets — incentivize thoughtful, strategic participation.

### Access

Deployable on any git hosting provider by non-technical users.

### Integrations

Out-of-the-box integration with GitHub and an API for building new integrations with git-based source authoring platforms.

## Why?

Credibility requires transparent governance

### Community scale

Open-source communities need a credible form of plural governance in order to scale.

### Fair and sustainable funding

Fair and sustainable funding mechanisms require an accurate and fine-grain record of attribution.

### Assurance of authenticity

Verifying the authenticity of a collaborative product requires a proof that every decision and contribution was performed according to governing community rules.

### Supply chain security

Plural mechanisms for adopting code changes are the ultimate measure against injection of malicious code or content.

## Where?

Alignment across peers

### AI alignment

At its core AI alignment is the act of collaboratively authoring training datasets while following plural arbitration practices.

### Identity in the age of AI

In the age of AI conventional proofs of personhood (such as all forms of Turing tests) are becoming increasingly unreliable. Governance participation records open a new avenue for establishing public identity and asserting personhood. Unlike simple bilateral tests, faking successful participation in governance requires fooling entire communities of people over long periods of time — a feat beyond the grasp of AI.

### Development of standards

Protocol and data standards are key to enabling interoperability and composeability across independent providers of data and services. Standards are developed by self-interested peering organizations, which need a fair arbitration mechanism to make progress.

### Decentralized Open Source

Success of Open Source products depends on the collaboration of expert strangers. Transparent decision-making and arbitration mechanisms are essential for reducing friction and establishing trust.

### Safe self-organizing

Communities in distress — such as in war zones, disaster zones or under oppressive regimes — often self-organize for purposes of coordination and sourcing of vital information. To prevent misinformation and harm, it is critical that shared information is certified with records of provenance and peer review.

### Deliberation and policymaking

Progressive democracies, such as Taiwan, have proven the effectiveness of plural, bottom-up policymaking. To scale such efforts, communities need secure, transparent and verifiable tools to conduct their deliberations.

## Foundation

The Gov4Git Foundation is a not-for-profit organization, dedicated to research and development of standards and tools for plural and decentralized governance of collaborative communities.
	
We believe that widely accessible protocols for bottom-up community governance and coordination are a crucial structural necessity for building robust societies — that are resilient to the occasional disastrous failings of centralized institutions, and that can harness the power of citizen innovation and creativity.

Access to practical and cost-effective community governance will dramatically reshape a myriad of social enterprises, such as grassroot innovation and exchange of ideas, self-organization in the face of disasters, democratic deliberation and policymaking, development of shared standards for public infrastructure, and much more.

Our mission is to empower the formation and sustainability of inclusive collaborative communities around the globe regardless of their socioeconomic environment, geopolitical context or persuasion.
